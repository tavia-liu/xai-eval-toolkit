- Large fruit bodies, free white gills, a stem with a zigzag pattern, a freely movable ring, a cap with large scales, a bulbous stem base without a volva (stages) or
- Stout fruit bodies, often intensely colored, white to cream gills, mild and fragile flesh (bolete mushrooms) or
- Stout fruit bodies, mild and fragile flesh, orange-red caps with greenish discolorations, red or orange latex (milk mushrooms) or
- Stout fruit bodies, white or with distinct brown fibers on the cap, mild flesh with an almond smell, turning red or not discoloring, free gills, initially pink, later turning brown to black (common mushrooms).","One should avoid species with a lamellar hymenophore, particularly:

- Green or olive caps, attached ring, white, free gills, bulbous stem with a volva, or
- White cap, attached ring, white, free gills, bulbous stem with a volva, stem surface with a zigzag white pattern, or
- Red, orange, brown, or yellow caps with remnants of the veil (in the form of patches and ""freckles""), stem with an attached ring, white, free gills, bulbous bases of stems with remnants of the universal veil, or

","An example of a variable causing a change in classification is the stem width – its increase from 7 to 41 mm causes a change in the identification of the fruiting body. Based on the above graphic, it's difficult to determine if this is a sufficient change, or if the model changes classification only after the second characteristic (qualitative) change, “stem surface.” I also don’t know how the AI model handles variables that weren’t defined in the first dataset (logically, it should assume the worst possible option, i.e., values assigned to the “poisonous” category).
